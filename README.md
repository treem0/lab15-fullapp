LAB: Full Application
Build a full back-end application

Before you begin
Refer to Getting Started in the lab submission instructions for complete setup, configuration, deployment, and submission instructions.

Requirements
Create a fully functioning application with authentication and CRUD routes. Make sure your CRUD routes are protected correctly. Who should be able to create data, access data, update data, and delete data.

For this Lab I went with an Activity tracking application. You can track the application by name, description, duration and date.


Stretch
build a front-end
create meaningful aggregations
add roles and admin routes
